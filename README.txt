* gaem

This is a fork of Silas Sewell's *Google App Engine Middleware (gaem)*, which is currently in his graveyard_ github repository.

** Original README by Silas Sewell

Google App Engine Middleware (gaem) is a collection of utilities for hosting external sites on Google App Engine.

I created gaem because I wanted to host my blog on an unreliable server and let Google App Engine serve the content while my server was down or in maintenance mode.

I plan on adding the following features:

- Initial and periodic crawler
- RESTful API for managing content
