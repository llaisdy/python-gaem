_Google App Engine Middleware (gaem)_ is a collection of utilities for hosting
external sites on Google App Engine.

I created gaem because I wanted to host my blog on an unreliable server and let
Google App Engine serve the content while my server was down or in maintenance
mode.

I plan on adding the following features:

 * Initial and periodic crawler
 * RESTful API for managing content
